Towers of Hanoi

Counting Inversions

Shunting 

Thread Trick (Java stack increase)

Log Trick

Compare products or exponents (compare a^b with c^d for example)

FFT where indices multiply, log all the indices then use regular FFT

Median Trick

Pitcher pouring

DFA
  DFA minimization
  DFA equality
  NFA to DFA [ASC 46 F]

Regex

Cheapest sort with moves
  LIS will stay in their spots, everything else moves

Cheapest sort with swaps
  For each permutation cycles, add length-1 (rotate the cycle)

Delta / Offset trick
  Keep delta for some DS, apply -delta to anything you insert

Slope trick
  Keep track of points where slope changes, optimal is slope 0

Coordinate Compression

Average Trick
  Binary search sum/n>=avg  ->  sum>=avg*n  ->  sum-avg*n>=0

Facebook trick
  Check if a subarray summing to a value exists, prefix hashsets

Flipping Cost Negation
  If operation to pay for is flipping: flip negatives, take cost, make positive

Maximum Rectangular Area in a Histogram (Maximum Perimeter)
