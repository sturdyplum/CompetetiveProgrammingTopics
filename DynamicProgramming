Longest Increasing Subsequence
  2D LIS: sort increasing x, tiebreak by decreasing y; then take LIS on y
  Extract LIS: Keep pointers to who you would attach to, then work backwards from the last boy

Inverted state

Implicit state

DP with a large transition, must take a minimum amount: might be able to do an O(1) take minimum amount transition, and an O(1) extend amount by 1 transition
